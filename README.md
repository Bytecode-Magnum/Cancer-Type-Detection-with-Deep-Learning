# Cancer Type Detection with Deep Learning

## Project Overview

Cancer Type Detection with Deep Learning is an ambitious project that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to accurately classify various types of cancer from medical images. We use transfer learning with the Inception V3 architecture to fine-tune a pre-trained model and make it proficient at identifying different cancer types based on input images.

## Project Details

### [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images)

Our project relies on a comprehensive cancer image dataset, carefully curated and structured into distinct subsets:

- **Training Dataset**: This dataset is the foundation for training the model. It consists of a diverse collection of annotated cancer images.

- **Validation Dataset**: For fine-tuning the model and optimizing hyperparameters, the validation dataset plays a crucial role in ensuring the model's robustness.

- **Testing Dataset**: Reserved exclusively for evaluating the model's performance on previously unseen data, the testing dataset helps us determine how well the model generalizes to real-world cases.

### Transfer Learning

Our approach hinges on the concept of transfer learning. By starting with a pre-trained Inception V3 model – a neural network with a proven track record in image classification – we customize it for our specific cancer type classification task. We retain the invaluable feature extraction capabilities of Inception V3 while adapting the output layers to meet our project's objectives.

### Model Architecture

The project's model architecture is designed for precision and efficiency:

- **Inception V3 Convolutional Base**: The Inception V3 pre-trained model forms the foundation, extracting meaningful features from input images.

- **Custom Classification Layers**: We introduce custom fully connected layers for cancer type classification.

- **Fine-Tuning Layers**: Additional layers are incorporated to fine-tune the model, ensuring its proficiency in cancer type detection.

### Libraries and Frameworks Used

The project thrives on the capabilities of the following libraries and frameworks:

- **TensorFlow and Keras**: These tools enable us to construct, train, and evaluate our deep learning model effectively.

- **Scikit-Learn**: This library streamlines data preprocessing, dataset splitting, and model performance assessment.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: We use these libraries for data visualization and result analysis.

- **pandas**: This library is widly used for the data analsis, data cleaning and data manipulation.

## Usage

To replicate the project's results and apply it to your dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Organize your cancer image dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.

2. **Model Training**: Execute the training script to fine-tune the Inception V3 model with your dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on the testing dataset using the evaluation script.

4. **Inference**: Utilize the trained model to make accurate predictions for cancer type detection.

## Results

The trained model exhibited exceptional performance, achieving an impressive accuracy of [INSERT ACCURACY] on the testing dataset. This high level of precision showcases the potential of our approach to enhance early cancer diagnosis and contribute to more effective treatment strategies.

## Future Improvements

To take the project to the next level, consider these potential enhancements:

- **Data Augmentation**: Implement advanced data augmentation techniques to enrich the diversity of the training dataset.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Explore various hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance further.

- **Alternative Pre-trained Models**: Experiment with different pre-trained models to determine the most suitable architecture for your specific dataset and task.
